# Why "Bobok"
<dl><dd>
When a terrible drought struck the Yaqui lands, the sparrow and the swallow carried pleas to the rain god, Yuku, but no answer came. All hope seemed lost until they called upon Bobok, a wise toad who knew delivery was everything. On borrowed bat wings, he flew to the heavens and confronted the god. With blunt conviction, he demanded Yuku do his duty, proving to be the only messenger capable of the task.
